# 🚀 Practice Programs Repository

Welcome to my **Practice Programs** repository! 🎉  
This repo contains a mix of **small coding exercises** and **mini projects**, built to practice programming concepts, problem-solving, and web development.  

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repo is organized into two main categories:

- **mini-programs/** → small exercises and algorithmic challenges.  
- **projects/** → larger, more complete projects (often including multiple files, HTML/CSS/JS, or more advanced logic).  

Each category is divided by programming language:
├── mini-programs/
│ ├── java/ # Algorithmic challenges (FizzBuzz, Palindrome, etc.)
│ └── javascript/ # Small JS practice programs (creditCardChecker, etc.)
│
├── projects/
│ ├── java/ # (Reserved for bigger Java projects in the future)
│ └── javascript/ # Web-based mini projects (FlipTheCoin, ClickCounter, etc.)
│
└── README.md

## 📚 Contents

### 🔹 Mini Programs
- **Java ☕**: Foundational exercises like:
  - FizzBuzz, Palindrome, Odd/Even, Prime checker, Password checker, etc.
  - Small OOP practice: Bank, Droid, School.
- **JavaScript 🟨**: Logic-focused practice scripts:
  - creditCardChecker, mysteriousOrganism, sleepDebtChecker.

### 🔹 Projects
- **JavaScript 🕹️ Web Projects**:
  - `FlipTheCoin/` → Coin toss simulator (HTML, CSS, JS + SVG assets).  
  - `ClickCounter/` → Simple click counter app (HTML, CSS, JS).  
  - `mixedMessages/` → Random message generator (JS).  
- **Java ☕**: Space reserved for larger Java-based projects (coming soon).

## 🤔 Why this Repository?
This is my personal playground to:
- Practice algorithms, problem-solving, and OOP.
- Build small but functional projects.
- Track my growth as I learn new languages and concepts.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Bash scripts for automation.  
- More complete Java & JavaScript apps.  
- Expand into frameworks and tools (Node.js, Docker, etc.).
